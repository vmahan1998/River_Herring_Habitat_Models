We propose that there are temporal and spatial differences in the larval growth and mortality of river herring and that these differences are species specific. (Overton et al., 2012)

Due to their differences in biology, a single management plan will affect each species differently and exploitation within a river system may be biased towards one species (Schmidt et al 2003).
