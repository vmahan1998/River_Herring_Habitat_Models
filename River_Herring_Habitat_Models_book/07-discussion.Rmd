# Discussion

## Model Results
- Utility
  - management
  - what do the results tell us
  
- Limitations
  - regional 
  - accuracy based on current knowledge
  - prediction power
  
- Compare to similar models (Pardue & Brown)

other factors impacting habitat health that could be added in the future
- nitrogen
- dissolved oxygen
- PH levels
"Blueback eggs and larvae to pulses of acidified water 
(pH 5.5 to 5.6) was reported to increase their 
mortality rate substantially (Klauda, 1987; see also 
Byrne, 1988). The pH of many Cape and Island soils is 
roughly in tnis range, and the ability of these soils 
to neutralize additional acidic inputs is limited. Bourne 1990)

## Model Communication

- Discussion of whether the model is communicated effectively for accurate and easy application in other project locations. 
- Are the assumptions and limitations staated clearly
- Is the model clear? (are the breakpoints presented in a way that is clear and understandable)
- Are the results understandable? What do the results mean?
