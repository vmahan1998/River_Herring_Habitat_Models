"Blueback eggs and larvae to pulses of acidified water 
(pH 5.5 to 5.6) was reported to increase their 
mortality rate substantially (Klauda, 1987; see also 
Byrne, 1988). The pH of many Cape and Island soils is 
roughly in tnis range, and the ability of these soils 
to neutralize additional acidic inputs is limited. Bourne 1990)
