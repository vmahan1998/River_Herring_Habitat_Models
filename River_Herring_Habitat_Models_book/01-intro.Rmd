potential sources:

- However, overexploitation has reduced the population size of both species throughout their ranges (Gibson and Myers 2003; Schmidt et al. 2003).

- Widespread declines in these stocks and those of other alosine species have been attributed to overfishing, degraded water quality, and loss of habitat (Crecco and Savoy 1984; Kosa and Mather 2001).
