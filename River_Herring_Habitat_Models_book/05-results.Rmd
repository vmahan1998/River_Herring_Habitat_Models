### Study Area
 We do not know right now the precise 
places where the herring spawn within Squibnocket 
and its tributary brooks and pond and salinity conditions where spawning occurs. spawn successfully in the slightly brackish water 
at the west end of the Pond (or elsewhere within 
it), or whether they manage to work their way up 
little tributaries. Bourne 1990.
