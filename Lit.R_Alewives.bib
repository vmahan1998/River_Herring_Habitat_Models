Both Mysis and adult alewife concentrated on the bottom during day and migrated upwards to the base of the thermocline at night. Extent and timing of vertical migrations of Mysis and alewife coincided. During bright moonlight Mysis concentrated at depths well below the thermocline and larger adult alewives concentrated within this Mysis layer while smaller adult alewives migrated to the base of the thermocline. An examination of stomach contents indicated that vertical migrations were mechanistically linked to feeding behavior. Adult alewives fed extensively on Mysis at night. Total lengths of Mysis in alewife stomachs were significantly longer than total lengths of Mysis captured in vertical plankton tows. Pontoporeia hoyi occurred in alewife stomachs in late afternoon (September) and early evening (June, October). Microcrustacean zooplankton were eaten mostly during day (June) or early morning (October). As Mysis was the most important food, the vertical migration of alewives is interpreted as an adaptation for feeding on vertically migrating Mysis.Key words: alewives, Lake Michigan, Mysis, Pontoporeia hoyi, vertical migration, feeding ecology, light},

Pacific salmon ( Oncorhynchus spp.) strongly impact nutrient dynamics in inland waters and anadromous alewife ( Alosa pseudoharengus ) may play a similar ecological role along the Atlantic coast. The annual spawning migration of anadromous alewife contributes, on average, 1050 g of nitrogen and 120 g of phosphorus to Bride Brook, Connecticut, USA, through excretion and mortality each year. Natural abundance stable isotope analyses indicate that this influx of marine-derived nitrogen is rapidly incorporated into the stream food web. An enriched δ
              15
              N signal, indicative of a marine origin, is present at all stream trophic levels with the greatest level of enrichment coincident with the timing of the anadromous alewife spawning migration. There was no significant effect of this nutrient influx on water chemistry, leaf decomposition, or periphyton accrual. Dam removal and fish ladder construction will allow anadromous alewife to regain access to historical freshwater spawning habitats, potentially impacting food web dynamics and nutrient cycling in coastal freshwater systems.},

Because of their diadromous life history, variability in rates of survival in fresh water can affect overall recruitment. The objective of our study was to assess how river temperature and flow influence young of the year (YOY) river herring recruitment in the Northeast US. Observations of adult and juvenile fish in five rivers were used to construct spawner–YOY recruits models; these rivers were chosen because of the length of the time series ({\textgreater}15 years) and the paired observations of spawners and juveniles. An environmentally explicit stock–recruitment model explained a substantial fraction (41\% to 80\%) of the variance in YOY abundance, depending on river system. Our approach allowed for a preliminary discussion of potential mechanisms, which need to be further substantiated by focused field and laboratory studies. Early summer river flow and river temperature had the greatest influence, indicating the importance of conditions in nursery habitats. In certain systems, spring or fall conditions were also important determinants of survival, suggesting additional effects of the environment on spawning of adults and juvenile egress from freshwater nursery habitats.},

We used logistic generalized additive models to characterize the average ingress, peak, and egress timing of spawning. In the 2010s, alewife arrived to spawning habitat 16 days earlier and egressed 27 days earlier (peak 12 days earlier) relative to the 1970s. Blueback herring arrived 5 days earlier and egressed 23 days earlier (peak 13 days earlier) in the 2010s relative to the 1980s. The changes in ingress and egress timing have shortened the occurrence in spawning systems by 11 days for alewife over four decades and 18 days for blueback herring over three decades. We found that the rate of vernal warming was faster during 2001–2016 relative to 1973–1988 and is the most parsimonious explanation for changes in spawning phenology. The influence of a shortened spawning season on river herring population dynamics warrants further investigation.},

            The term river herring collectively refers to alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and blueback herring (A. aestivalis), two anadromous fishes distributed along the east coast of North America. Historically, river herring spawning migrations supported important fisheries, and their spawning runs continue to be of cultural significance to many coastal communities. Recently, substantial declines in spawning run size prompted a petition to consider river herring for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA status review process requires an evaluation of a species’ response to multiple stressors, including climate change. For anadromous species that utilize a range of habitats throughout their life cycle, the response to a changing global climate is inherently complex and likely varies regionally. River herring occupy marine habitat for most of their lives, and we demonstrate that their relative abundance in the ocean has been increasing in recent years. We project potential effects of ocean warming along the US Atlantic coast on river herring in two seasons (spring and fall), and two future periods (2020–2060 and 2060–2100) by linking species distribution models to projected temperature changes from global climate models. Our analyses indicate that climate change will likely result in reductions in total suitable habitat across the study region, which will alter the marine distribution of river herring. We also project that density will likely decrease for both species in fall, but may increase in spring. Finally, we demonstrate that river herring may have increased sensitivity to climate change under a low abundance scenario. This result could be an important consideration for resource managers when planning for climate change because establishing effective conservation efforts in the near term may improve population resiliency and provide lasting benefits to river herring populations.},

Performance was strictly voluntary: no coercive incentives were used to motivate fish to sprint. We used these data to generate models of maximum distance traversed, taking into account effects of flow velocity, body length, and temperature. Although the maximum distance traversed decreased with increasing velocity, the magnitude of this effect varied among species. Other covariate effects were likewise variable, with divergent effects of temperature and nonuniform length effects. These effects do not account for all of the variability in performance, however, and behavioral traits may account for observed interspecific differences. We propose the models be used to develop criteria for fish passage structures, culverts, and breached dams.},

            The bycatch of river herring (Alosa pseudoharengus and A. aestivalis) and American shad (A. sapidissima) by midwater trawl vessels targeting Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) has become a possible threat to their conservation. Most bycatch occurs during winter when the regional distributions of these five species overlap. The life histories and habits of these species suggest that there are times and areas during winter where overlap is low and bycatch could be reduced. This study identified environmental conditions associated with the presence of river herring and American shad during winter in the US Mid-Atlantic area by testing the hypothesis that fish were detected in an equal proportion to the amount of samples taken within an environmental condition. River herring were associated with colder temperatures and relatively shallow depths, while American shad appeared to be associated with a broader habitat. To determine whether these associations could be used to reduce bycatch, the proportion of effort and catch of target and bycatch species under the conditions associated with bycatch species presence was quantified in a fishery-dependent dataset. Targeting Atlantic mackerel in waters with surface temperatures above 6°C appeared to be the most effective advice for reducing river herring bycatch.},

	abstract = {The identification of important spawning and nursery habitats for fish stocks can aid fisheries management, but is complicated by various factors, including annual variation in recruitment success. The alewife ( Alosa pseudoharengus ) is an ecologically important species in Lake Michigan that utilizes a variety of habitats for spawning and early life growth. While productive, warm tributary mouths (connected to Lake Michigan) may contribute disproportionately more recruits (relative to their habitat volume) to the adult alewife population than cooler, less productive nearshore habitats, the extent of interannual variation in the relative contributions of recruits from these two habitat types remains unknown. We used an individual-based bioenergetics simulation model and input data on daily temperatures to estimate alewife recruitment to the adult population by these different habitat types. Simulations suggest that nearshore lake habitats typically produce the vast majority of young alewife recruits. However, tributary habitats may contribute the majority of alewife recruits during years of low recruitment. We suggest that high interannual variation in the relative importance of habitats for recruitment is a common phenomenon, which should be considered when developing habitat management plans for fish populations.},

	abstract = {The sustained production of sufficient forage is critical to advancing ecosystem-based management, yet factors that affect local abundances and habitat conditions necessary to support aggregate forage production remain largely unexplored. We quantified suitable habitat in the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries for four key forage fishes: juvenile spotted hake
              Urophycis regia
              , juvenile spot
              Leiostomus xanthurus
              , juvenile weakfish
              Cynoscion regalis
              , and bay anchovy
              Anchoa mitchilli
              . We used information from monthly fisheries surveys from 2000 to 2016 coupled with hindcasts from a spatially interpolated model of dissolved oxygen and a 3-D hydrodynamic model of the Chesapeake Bay to identify influential covariates and construct habitat suitability models for each species. Suitable habitat conditions resulted from a complex interplay between water quality and geophysical properties of the environment and varied among species. Habitat suitability indices ranging between 0 (poor) and 1 (superior) were used to estimate seasonal and annual extents of suitable habitats. Seasonal variations in suitable habitat extents in Chesapeake Bay, which were more pronounced than annual variations during 2000–2016, reflected the phenology of estuarine use by these species. Areas near shorelines served as suitable habitats in spring for juvenile spot and in summer for juvenile weakfish, indicating the importance of these shallow areas for production. Tributaries were more suitable for bay anchovy in spring than during other seasons. The relative baywide abundances of juvenile spot and bay anchovy were significantly related to the extent of suitable habitats in summer and winter, respectively, indicating that Chesapeake Bay habitats may be limiting for these species. In contrast, the relative baywide abundances of juvenile weakfish and juvenile spotted hake varied independently of the spatial extent of suitable habitats. In an ecosystem-based approach, areas that persistently provide suitable conditions for forage species such as shoreline and tributary habitats may be targeted for protection or restoration, thereby promoting sufficient production of forage for predators. Further, quantitative habitat targets or spatial thresholds may be developed for habitat-limited species using estimates of the minimum habitat area required to produce a desired abundance or biomass; such targets or thresholds may serve as spatial reference points for management.},

              aestivalis
              —collectively referred to as river herring—exhibit complex life histories, exploiting freshwater and marine biomes to complete their life cycles. We investigated distribution patterns of river herring in the Penobscot River estuary, Maine, USA, from April through September in 2012 and 2013 and found both species in relatively low‐salinity portions of the estuary in all months sampled. River herring made up the majority of samples in terms of abundance and biomass for most months. We developed age–length keys for monthly catches and found consistent presence of age‐1 and age‐2 river herring, especially during spring. We found seasonal patterns in age distribution with age‐1 fish and older most abundant in spring and summer and age‐0 fish only occurring in late summer through fall. These observations provide direct evidence of life cycle diversity for juvenile river herring, complementing other recent observations in other parts of their native range. Lastly, our findings suggest further consideration should be given to the importance of connectivity between marine, estuarine, and freshwater habitats for age‐1 and age‐2 river herring and to the more complex ecological roles of age‐1 and age‐2 river herring given their intermediate trophic level and presence in relatively fresh components of the Penobscot River estuary.},

Many North American species are critically endangered, and entire populations have been lost. Major factors driving declines include overfishing, pollution, water withdrawals, aquaculture, non-native species, habitat degradation, over-zealous application of hatcheries designed to mitigate effects of other factors, and effects of climate change. Perhaps, the most broadly tractable and effective factors affecting diadromous fishes are removals of the dams that prevent or hinder their migrations, alter their environment, and often favor non-native biotic communities. Future survival of many diadromous fish populations may depend on this.
